        <div class="refund-policy">
          <h2>1. Eligibility for Refund</h2>

          <p>We offer a 30-day refund policy for all course purchases. If, for any reason, you are not satisfied with your purchase, you may request a full refund within 30 days of the original purchase date, provided the course has not been completed in full.</p>

          <p>A course is considered "completed" once you have viewed or marked all chapters as completed.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="refund-policy">
          <h2>2. Technical Issues</h2>

          <p>If you experience any technical difficulties that prevent you from accessing your course, please reach out to us via [contact methods, e.g., email or a contact form]. We are committed to resolving any issues promptly. However, if you still wish to request a refund, you may do so within 30 days of your purchase, regardless of whether the technical issue was resolved.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="refund-policy">
          <h2>3. Refund Process</h2>

          <p>Refunds are issued back to the original payment method used for purchase. Once a refund is approved, processing times may vary based on your financial institution and payment processor (Stripe). We aim to initiate the refund promptly upon approval, but please allow up to [estimated range based on Stripe's processing time] for the refund to appear in your account.</p>

        <div class="refund-policy">
          <h2>4. Discounted Courses</h2>

          <p>If you purchased a course at a discount or during a promotional period, the refund amount will reflect the amount actually paid at the time of purchase.</p>

          <h2>5. How to Request a Refund</h2>

          <p>We strive to review all refund requests as they come in. However, as a small operation, processing times may vary depending on demand. We appreciate your patience and understanding.</p>
