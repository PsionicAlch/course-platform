          <h2>1. Eligibility for Refund</h2>

          <p>We offer a 30-day refund policy for all course purchases. If, for any reason, you are not satisfied with your purchase, you may request a full refund within 30 days of the original purchase date, provided the course has not been completed in full.</p>

          <h2>2. Technical Issues</h2>

          <p>If you experience any technical difficulties that prevent you from accessing your course, please reach out to us via [contact methods, e.g., email or a contact form]. We are committed to resolving any issues promptly.

          <p>Refunds are issued back to the original payment method used for purchase.

We aim to initiate the refund promptly upon approval, but please allow up to [estimated range based on Stripe's processing time] for the refund to appear in your account.</p>
