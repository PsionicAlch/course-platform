          <h2>Course Overview</h2>

          <p>This project-driven course will take you step-by-step through creating a real-world course platform from scratch. Unlike traditional courses that end in toy applications, this course empowers you to build a deployable, scalable, and reusable web application that can serve as the foundation for your own courses or business. By the end, you'll walk away with a complete platform - ready to be customized, launched, and monetized.</p>

          <h2>What You'll Learn</h2>

          <p>This course dives into the key technologies and techniques for building and launching a professional-grade course platform:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><b>Go for Web Development:</b> Learn how to leverage Golang's performance and simplicity to build fast, responsive web applications.</li>
            <li><b>HTMX and AlpineJS:</b> Transform multi-page applications into responsive, SPA-like experiences without needing a complex JavaScript framework.</li>
            <li><b>Database Integration:</b> Build efficient, robust database interactions in Go, tailored to your platform's needs.</li>
            <li><b>Custom Authentication:</b> Develop a secure, reusable authentication and authorization system to protect your content.</li>
            <li><b>Email Handling in Go:</b> Learn how to automate and send emails directly from your application.</li>
            <li><b>Docker for Deployment:</b> Containerize your application for efficient, reproducible deployment on any environment.</li>
            <li><b>VPS Deployment and Scaling:</b> Set up a VPS to host your platform in a scalable, cost-effective way.</li>
            <li><b>Stripe Integration:</b> Add payment capabilities to monetize your courses, enabling students to make seamless transactions.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Each module contributes to a cohesive platform that's ready for production and showcases your skills with real, deployable code.</p>

          <p><b>No Heavy Frameworks Needed:</b> This course introduces you to building dynamic, responsive apps using Go, HTMX, and AlpineJS without leaning on large JavaScript frameworks. You'll learn modern techniques to achieve high performance with minimal dependencies.</p>

          <p><b>Project-Driven and Modular:</b> With a strong focus on modular, reusable code, you'll gain skills to build applications from scratch and learn how to reuse core components like authentication and payment integrations in future projects.</p>

          <h2>What You'll Walk Away With</h2>
