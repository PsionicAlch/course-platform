## Course Overview

Take your web development skills to the next level by building a real-world application with Golang, HTMX, AlpineJS, and Tailwind CSS. This course guides you through the complete process of creating a scalable, modern web app designed for production environments. Whether you're a developer looking to boost your portfolio or an entrepreneur ready to build your own platform, this course equips you with the tools and knowledge you need.

## What You'll Learn

In this comprehensive course, you'll gain hands-on experience with the following technologies and techniques:

- **Golang for Backend Development:** Harness Go's simplicity and efficiency to build robust backend systems.
- **HTMX for Dynamic Interactions:** Create engaging, single-page app-like experiences without the complexity of large JavaScript frameworks.
- **AlpineJS for Lightweight Enhancements:** Enhance interactivity with a modern, declarative JavaScript library.
- **Tailwind CSS for Modern Styling:** Design sleek, responsive interfaces with minimal effort.
- **API Development:** Build RESTful APIs to power your application and integrate with third-party services.
- **Authentication and Authorization:** Secure your application with a reusable system for user accounts and permissions.
- **Payment Integration:** Implement Stripe for seamless payment processing and monetization.
